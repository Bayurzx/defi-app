# *Tutorial* : Create a simple countdown timer with ReactJS

We will be using React-Hooks to create a simple countdown timer.

## Summary
- We will be using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from react to pass state, mount and update state as it changes.
- Make use of `setInterval` to utilze its time change properties
- convert seconds to a user friendly view on render

Writing a countdown timer in react turned out to be... "not-so-easy". Especially, if you do not fully understand how state change works and how react hooks update them on render, and some blog tutorials kinda made it a bit more complicated than it should. Hence why we are here.
